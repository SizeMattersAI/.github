# SizeMatters 🌍🍌

Welcome to the official **SizeMatters Organization** repository! Our mission is to revolutionize the way we interact with personal metrics, gamification, and community engagement using cutting-edge AI, blockchain technology, and a touch of humor.

## Projects

### 1. SizeMatters App

A groundbreaking app that combines AI and blockchain to create the first Proof of Measurement (PoM) protocol. Leveraging tools like PoseNet, DeepFace, and LiDAR, we aim to provide accurate and verifiable measurements while maintaining privacy and security.

**Features:**
- Fun, gamified challenges and leaderboards.
- AI-generated size metrics with optional NFT verification.
- ZK-proof implementation for privacy-first metrics on Solana blockchain.
